# Holy-Island

Holy Island is a third person dungeon crawler rogue-like inspired by the likes of Diablo and The Binding Of Isaac. The game is set on the titular Holy Island,
where you play as a Viking raider who has come to raid the temple found there for its riches. The player will decend into the basement, and then catacombs found
beneath the temple, where they will slowly lose their sanity as they progress through outlandish planes of reality. 

## Mechanics

Holy Island is a rogue-like with procedurally generated levels created from a set of possible rooms for each level. Much like many other rogue-likes, the player
will explore the levels, fighting enemies in each room and finding or buying loot. Some where on each level there will be a boss, which can be defeated to move
to the next level.

The combat of the game takes inspiration from Diablo and other dungeon crawler CRPGs, with the player having access to a base set of attacks which they are able
in change and improve via the collection of items throughout the game. Some of these items will be as simple as damage boosts, while others will change the
players attacks in more varied ways.
